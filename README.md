## About the Course

"Python for Everybody" is an introductory programming course that focuses on teaching the fundamentals of programming using the Python language. The course covers a wide range of topics, including variables, data types, control structures, functions, file handling, and basic data analysis.

By enrolling in this course, I had the opportunity to dive into the world of programming and explore the versatility and power of Python. Throughout the course, I gained hands-on experience through coding exercises, assignments, and projects. This repository serves as a portfolio of my work during the course.

Happy coding!
